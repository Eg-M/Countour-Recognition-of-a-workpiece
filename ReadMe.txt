========================================================================


This file contains a summary of the contents of all files included in the open_cv_contour_recognition application.

This is the main VC++ project file created using the Application Wizard. It contains information about the Visual C++ language version used to create the file, as well as information about the platforms, configurations and functions of the project selected using the Application Wizard.

open_cv_contour_recognition.vcxproj.filters
This is a filter file for VC++ projects created using the Application Wizard. It contains information about the mappings between files in your project and filters. These mappings are used in the IDE to group files with the same extensions in one node (for example, CPP files are mapped to the "Source Files" filter).

open_cv_contour_recognition.cpp
This is the main source file of the application.
